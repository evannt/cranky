            <h3>Game Functionality</h3>
            <p>The game is played over <strong>7 rounds</strong>. In each round, you're dealt 7 cards and must
                <strong>choose up to 5 cards</strong> to form your
                final hand. By default, you may discard up to 3 cards, but jokers can grant additional discards. Chips
                can be
                used to purchase jokers, which apply special effects or improve hand scoring. Any chips you have
                left at the end of a round carry over to the next one.

            <h3>Scoring System</h3>
            <p>Each hand's total score is determined by three components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hand Score</strong> - Based on the type of poker hand (e.g., Full House, Straight, etc.).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hand Multiplier</strong> - Multiplies your base score; affected by certain augments and
                    jokers.</li>
                <li><strong>Card Values</strong> - Only the cards that form the poker hand contribute to this.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="rule-jokersSection">
            <h3>Jokers</h3>
            <p>Jokers are special cards that enhance your hand by applying modifiers that can increase your score, boost
                multipliers, or alter how your hand is evaluated. Their effects apply only to the five cards that make
                up
                your final poker handâ€”any extra cards that don't contribute to the hand type are ignored. You can hold
                up to
                <strong>3 jokers</strong> at a time. If you want to obtain a new joker while already at the
                limit, you can click the <strong>"Burn"</strong> button on one of your current jokers to remove it and
                make
                space. You may also burn a joker at any time as part of your strategy.
